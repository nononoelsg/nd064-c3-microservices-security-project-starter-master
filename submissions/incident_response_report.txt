2.Executive summary of what happened
   - There was an attack where the attacker deploy 3 different crypto miner pods. 
   - The 3 pods take up majority of the cluster CPU which impacted the client normal services.

3.Summary of what was affected
   - The attacker was able to access the cluster to run their mining software which heavily utilized the cluster.
   - This will cause the service request for client to slow down greatly. 

4.Summary of the impact
  Gafana dashboard shows that the CPU usage produced spikes when the attacker access the cluster and run the software.

5.Summary of the remediation steps
   - The administrator can force delete pods from the cluster: kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force
   - The administrator can limit admin access to the resources
   - The administrator can check CPU usage back to normal

6.Summary of lessons learned
    - Cluster should be harden with tighten/restrict of priviledge access to the Kubernetes API server.
    - Admission can disallow malicious images to be used to create containers.
    - We can set alert if the CPU goes up to 100%. This is use to notify admin if there is a surge of event in unusual activities.
